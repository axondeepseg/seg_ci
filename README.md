This repo uses GitHub's Action tool to automatically install and test each major versions of AxonDeepSeg (v1-v5), and runs a segmentation on an SEM and TEM image(downloaded from this repo -> https://github.com/axondeepseg/data_ci)

The main shell script and GitHub actions are modifications of the QSM-CI implementation, https://github.com/QSMxT/QSM-CI.
